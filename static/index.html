                                Pokémon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokémon, albeit with a
                                different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The concept of
                                the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of
                                Pokémon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri
                                enjoyed as a child.[30] Players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three

                                In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon is
                                able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical
                                tool called a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the
                                Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it
                                will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer
                                demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own
                                accord.
